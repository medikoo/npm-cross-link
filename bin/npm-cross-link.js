Usage: npm-cross-link [-h | --help] [--no-pull] [--push] [<package-name>]

When <package-name> is provided, it is ensured it's installed and is up to date,
as located in npm packages folder
(there are no updates made to eventual project at current working directory)

When <package-name> is not provided then all dependencies of a project at
current working directory are ensured to be linked or installed
up to npm-cross-link installation rules

Options:

    --pull      Pull changes from remote
    --push      Push committed changes to remote
    --help, -h  Show this message
